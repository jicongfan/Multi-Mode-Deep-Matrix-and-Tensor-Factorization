# Multi-Mode-Deep-Matrix-and-Tensor-Factorization

This repo contains the main (MATLAB) codes of the following paper:
Jicong Fan. Multi-Mode Deep Matrix and Tensor Factorization. ICLR 2022.

Note that the documentation is a little bit coarse.

M2DMTF_matrix is for matrix completion

examples: synthetic matrix, movielens100k

M2DMTF_tensor is for tensor completion

examples: synthetic tensor, movielens100k, a few other real tensors
